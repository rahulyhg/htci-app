# HTCI

This is an Ionic Framework based app for the Hindu Temple of Central Indiana.

# Development

If you want to check out this repo and help develop, you'll need to install these Cordova plugins in addition to all of the Ionic Framework stuff.

Run `cordova prepare` to install all plugins listed in `confix.xml`. However, if developing for Android, also install `cordova-plugin-whitelist`.

# Note to Self
Change bundle id to htci-app before updating on android.
